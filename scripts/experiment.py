experiment.py: the only honest way Token Shield produces a VERIFIED saving.

A prevented event is a counterfactual, so it is at best ESTIMATED, never
verified. The only thing that earns VERIFIED is a real before/after: measure,
change one thing, measure again over the SAME window, and refuse the comparison
if anything that would invalidate it changed.

  python3 experiment.py start "shrink-claude-md"   # pins a baseline now
  ...do the one change, work normally for a while...
  python3 experiment.py end "shrink-claude-md"     # compares, writes one record
  python3 experiment.py report                     # per-label rows, never summed

Each ended experiment appends ONE record to ~/.claude/token-shield/savings.jsonl,
the append-only proof ledger the dashboard reads for its VERIFIED column. The
comparison reuses the meter's own guards: it refuses across a schema change and
downgrades to NOT_PROVEN on a window mismatch or thin data, rather than print a
confident number that means nothing.

v2 adds four more guards on top of the v1 before/after:
  - cohorts are built from each usage record's own message timestamp, not the
    session file's mtime, so a transcript resumed from before the experiment
    only contributes the records that actually fall inside the window, and it
    contributes no startup floor at all because its first turn is not in there;
  - the after cohort is refused outright (no ledger write) if it would start
    at or before the before cohort ended, since touching windows put the same
    boundary record on both sides of the comparison;
  - a config fingerprint (CLAUDE.md, settings.json, ~/.claude.json, every
    skills/*/SKILL.md, installed plugin dirs) is taken at start and end; if it
    moved for any reason other than the named --treats target, the verdict
    downgrades to NOT_PROVEN rather than credit an unrelated config change.
    Whatever --treats excludes is listed on the record and printed at the end,
    because a blind spot nobody can see is worse than no guard at all. A JSON
    file in the fingerprint is hashed in canonical form with its volatile
    keys (~/.claude.json's own lastUsedAt, usageCount) stripped first, since
    those move on their own several times a minute with no config change
    involved; a baseline's fingerprint_start pinned under an older hashing
    method is never compared byte-for-byte against a fresh fingerprint_end,
    since that would look like "config changed" for no reason but the
    hashing itself, so a method mismatch reports NO DATA instead;
  - a baseline pinned before those guards existed carries none of them, so it
    is not comparable under them: it can never be VERIFIED, only NOT_PROVEN
    with the legacy baseline named as the reason.

        side missing it (a baseline pinned before this field existed) is

        the spread is defined against that median; exactly one side
        carrying a p90 is itself a downgrade, both sides missing it stays
        silent UNLESS a modern summary reports fewer than 10 first-request
        sessions on either side, which is named as its own downgrade rather

    cmd_end never deletes or marks the file it reads, so this is the only way
    to tell 'started, never ended' from 'started, ended, file just still there'.
    Returns a list of the raw baseline dicts (label, started, fingerprint_start,
    treats, ...), sorted by started ascending, [] when nothing is open.

    Fails CLOSED, not open: a .json in exp_dir that cannot be read (permission
    denied, truncated mid-write by a crash) or does not parse as a JSON object
    (corrupt, or a stray non-dict value) is not skipped. It is impossible to
    tell such a file apart from a genuinely open experiment whose baseline
    write got interrupted, and a skip-on-unreadable rule would let an apply
    run unchallenged right through that gap. It comes back instead as a
    marker dict carrying "_unreadable" (the file's path) and no "label", so a
    caller can name the file directly rather than pretend to know its label.

    exp_dir/ledger default to the module globals EXP_DIR/LEDGER, looked up at
    call time (not bound as default-argument values), so a test that
